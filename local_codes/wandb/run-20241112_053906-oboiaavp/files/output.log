Epoch 100, Train Loss: 1.6422
Some weights of EsmModel were not initialized from the model checkpoint at facebook/esm2_t6_8M_UR50D and are newly initialized: ['esm.pooler.dense.bias', 'esm.pooler.dense.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
