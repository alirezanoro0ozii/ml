We strongly recommend passing in an `attention_mask` since your input_ids may be padded. See https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/troubleshooting#incorrect-output-when-padding-tokens-arent-masked.

- This IS expected if you are initializing BertForMaskedLM from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing BertForMaskedLM from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
